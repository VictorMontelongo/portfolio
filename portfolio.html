      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>My name is Victor Montelongo. I have started my journey in coding on September 18th. Prior to this I studying
        early modern history and worked in the finance world. Starting on the retail side of banking, I worked my way
        into the managerial and business sectors at the end prior to the Covid pandemic. Once the pandemic took me out
        of the office I had time to think and I decided to go back to get my Masters in history abroad in Uppsala
        Sweden. After spending two years there I returned back to Minnesota homesick and reflecting on wanting to get
        into the programming. Taking a few free coding lessons have sparked my interest in wanting to expand into this
        field of work and profession.</p>
